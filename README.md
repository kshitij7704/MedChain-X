# MedChain-X: Revolutionizing X-Ray Diagnosis with Blockchain and AI

## Introduction
MedChain-X is an innovative platform that combines deep learning and blockchain technology to provide fast, secure, and reliable X-ray diagnosis. By leveraging AI-based disease prediction and blockchain-backed data security, MedChain-X ensures instant medical insights while maintaining tamper-proof storage. 

## Features
- **AI-Powered Disease Detection**: Uses deep learning models to analyze X-ray images and predict diseases.
- **Secure Blockchain Storage**: Ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized access with Ethereum/Hyperledger integration.
- **Decentralized and Transparent**: Patients have complete control over their medical data.
- **Seamless Doctor Consultations**: Verified doctors can provide expert opinions through the platform.
- **Fast Processing**: AI predictions are generated within seconds, improving efficiency.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular / React.js  
- **Backend**: Flask / Node.js  
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum  
- **AI & Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (CNN-based classification)  
- **Storage**: IPFS for decentralized file storage  

## System Workflow
1. **User Registration & Authentication**: Patients and doctors securely log in.  
2. **X-Ray Upload**: Patients upload their X-ray images for analysis.  
3. **AI Diagnosis**: The deep learning model predicts possible diseases.  
4. **Blockchain Security**: X-ray hashes are stored on the blockchain to ensure tamper-proof access.  
5. **Doctor Consultation**: Patients can consult verified doctors for expert opinions.
